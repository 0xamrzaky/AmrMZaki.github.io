Since 6 years ago, I was writing at my Wordpress blog about the technology and about the problems where i faced when configuring some stuff.(Really missing those day <3)


During the past time, I have been learned a lot of technologies and entered at a lot of technical discussions and still learning till now.


Now, I return back to writing again from another managed service through GitHub website, this time i will write by my favorite syntax [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) engine will convert it to static. So no need to database engine to store posts


I hope to continue what i decide to do.
